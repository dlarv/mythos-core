v1.0.0
- [x] clean_cli_args returns iterator, not vec.
- [ ] Logger.printinfo(args*, bool), where bool decides whether info is printed
- [ ] Logger saves data to file.
- [ ] Conf can act as an abstraction over a directory, not just a file. I.e. if given a dir, conf will treat it as a config file containing a dict of lists(subdirs) and dicts(files).
